## What is dependency injection and what are the advantages of using it?
## What is an interface andwhat are the advantages of making use of them in Java?
## What is an ApplicationContext?
## How are you going to create a new instance of an ApplicationContext?
## Can you describe the lifecycle of a Spring Bean in an ApplicationContext?
## How are you going to create an ApplicationContext in an integration test?
## What is the preferred way to close an application context? Does Spring Boot do this for you?
## Are beans lazily or eagerly instantiated by default? How do you alter this behavior?
## What is a property source? How would you use @PropertySource?
## What is a BeanFactoryPostProcessor and what is it used for? When is it invoked?
## What is a BeanPostProcessor and how is it different to a BeanFactoryPostProcessor? What do they do? When are they called?
## What does component-scanning do?
## What is the behavior of the annotation @Autowired with regards to field injection, constructor injection and method injection?
## How does the @Qualifier annotation complement the use of @Autowired?
## What is a proxy object and what are the two different types of proxies Spring can create?
## What does the @Bean annotation do?
## What is the default bean id if you only use @Bean? How can you override this?
## Why are you not allowed to annotate a final class with @Configuration
## How do you configure profiles? What are possible use cases where they might be useful?
## Can you use @Bean together with @Profile?
## Can you use @Component together with @Profile?
## How many profiles can you have?
## How do you inject scalar/literal values into Spring beans?
## What is Spring Expression Language (SpEL for short)?
## What is the Environment abstraction in Spring?
## Where can properties in the environment come from – there are many sources for properties – check the documentation if not sure. Spring Boot adds even more. 
## What can you reference using SpEL?
## What is the difference between $ and # in @Value expressions?
